            <p>My name is Nephi Ulimuke-Ebegim Asha. I am a BYU-Pathway student from Cross River State, Nigeria. I'm 20 years of age. I currently returned from serving a full-time mission in both Nigeria Enugu Mission and Nigeria Owerri Mission. I'm currently pursuing a degree in software development.
                I love coding and it has been my passion since my childhood days. Outside academics, I love playing gaming, writing or listening to good and uplifting musics. Above is a photo of me. :)
